# Tab-Management Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Tab-Management feature will transform the Markdown Editor Pro from a single-document editor into a multi-document workspace. Users will be able to open, edit, and manage multiple Markdown documents simultaneously in separate tabs, with full persistence across browser sessions. Each tab will maintain its own state including content, filename, file handle (for save operations), and editor settings like cursor position and scroll state.

This feature addresses the need for users to work on multiple documents without losing context or having to constantly switch between files through the file system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Tab Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to open multiple Markdown documents in separate tabs, so that I can work on multiple documents simultaneously without losing my progress on any of them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display at least one tab (default "Untitled")
2. WHEN a user opens a new file THEN the system SHALL create a new tab with the file's name
3. WHEN a user clicks "New Document" THEN the system SHALL create a new tab with "Untitled" as the name
4. WHEN there are multiple tabs THEN the system SHALL display a tab bar above the editor area only
5. WHEN a user clicks on a tab THEN the system SHALL switch to that tab's content and state
6. WHEN a tab is active THEN the system SHALL visually indicate it as the current tab
7. WHEN there are more tabs than can fit in the viewport THEN the system SHALL provide horizontal scrolling for the tab bar
8. WHEN a tab is active THEN the preview area SHALL display the rendered content of that tab's markdown
9. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the preview area SHALL update to show the new active tab's content

### Requirement 2: Tab Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my open tabs to be restored when I reload the browser or return to the application, so that I don't lose my workspace setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL restore all previously open tabs from localStorage
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL restore the previously active tab
3. WHEN a tab is created or modified THEN the system SHALL persist the tab state to localStorage
4. WHEN a tab is closed THEN the system SHALL remove it from localStorage
5. IF localStorage is corrupted or unavailable THEN the system SHALL start with a single default tab
6. WHEN tab state is persisted THEN the system SHALL include content, filename, file handle reference, and editor state

### Requirement 3: Tab State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want each tab to remember its individual state (content, filename, save location, cursor position), so that switching between tabs preserves my work context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve each tab's markdown content
2. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve each tab's filename
3. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve each tab's file handle for save operations
4. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve each tab's cursor position and selection
5. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve each tab's scroll position
6. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve each tab's undo/redo history
7. WHEN a tab has unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL visually indicate this with a modified indicator (dot or asterisk)

### Requirement 4: Tab Closing and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to close tabs I no longer need and be warned about unsaved changes, so that I can manage my workspace efficiently without losing important work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the close button on a tab THEN the system SHALL close that tab
2. WHEN closing a tab with unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to save, discard, or cancel
3. WHEN the last tab is closed THEN the system SHALL create a new default "Untitled" tab
4. WHEN a tab is closed THEN the system SHALL activate the next available tab (or previous if closing the last tab)
5. WHEN there are multiple tabs THEN each tab SHALL display a close button (Ã—)
6. WHEN hovering over a tab close button THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback

### Requirement 5: File Operations Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want file operations (Save, Save As, Open) to work correctly with the active tab, so that I can manage files naturally within the tab context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Save" THEN the system SHALL save the active tab's content to its associated file handle
2. WHEN a user clicks "Save As" THEN the system SHALL save the active tab's content to a new location and update the tab's file handle
3. WHEN a user opens a file THEN the system SHALL check if it's already open in another tab and switch to that tab instead of creating a duplicate
4. WHEN a file is saved THEN the system SHALL update the tab's title to reflect the filename
5. WHEN a file is saved THEN the system SHALL remove the unsaved changes indicator from the tab
6. WHEN a user opens a file THEN the system SHALL create a new tab if the file is not already open

### Requirement 6: Keyboard Navigation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want keyboard shortcuts to navigate between tabs efficiently, so that I can maintain my workflow speed without reaching for the mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses Ctrl/Cmd + Tab THEN the system SHALL switch to the next tab
2. WHEN a user presses Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Tab THEN the system SHALL switch to the previous tab
3. WHEN a user presses Ctrl/Cmd + W THEN the system SHALL close the active tab (with unsaved changes prompt)
4. WHEN a user presses Ctrl/Cmd + T THEN the system SHALL create a new tab
5. WHEN a user presses Ctrl/Cmd + 1-9 THEN the system SHALL switch to the corresponding tab number (if it exists)

### Requirement 7: Tab Context Menu

**User Story:** As a user, I want right-click context menu options on tabs, so that I can perform common tab operations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks on a tab THEN the system SHALL display a context menu
2. WHEN the context menu is displayed THEN it SHALL include options: "Close Tab", "Close Other Tabs", "Close All Tabs", "Duplicate Tab"
3. WHEN "Close Other Tabs" is selected THEN the system SHALL close all tabs except the right-clicked tab
4. WHEN "Close All Tabs" is selected THEN the system SHALL close all tabs and create a new default tab
5. WHEN "Duplicate Tab" is selected THEN the system SHALL create a new tab with the same content but as "Untitled"

### Requirement 8: Visual Design Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tab interface to integrate seamlessly with the existing design system, so that the application maintains its professional appearance and usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tabs are displayed THEN they SHALL follow the existing theme system (light/dark mode)
2. WHEN tabs are displayed THEN they SHALL use consistent typography and spacing with the rest of the application
3. WHEN the tab bar is displayed THEN it SHALL be positioned above the editor area and not interfere with the existing toolbar layout
4. WHEN tabs have long names THEN they SHALL be truncated with ellipsis and show full name on hover
5. WHEN tabs are displayed THEN they SHALL provide clear visual hierarchy and state indication
6. WHEN tabs are displayed THEN the preview area SHALL remain unchanged and show content for the active tab only
7. WHEN the layout includes tabs THEN the editor-preview split SHALL remain functional with tabs affecting only the editor side

### Requirement 9: Performance and Memory Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remain responsive even with many tabs open, so that my editing experience is not degraded by the tab feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN the system SHALL only render the active tab's editor
2. WHEN switching tabs THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and responsive (< 100ms)
3. WHEN tabs are persisted THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage localStorage space
4. WHEN many tabs are open THEN the system SHALL not cause memory leaks or performance degradation
5. WHEN tabs contain large documents THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without blocking the UI

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tab system to handle errors gracefully and recover from issues, so that I don't lose my work due to technical problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN localStorage fails to save tab state THEN the system SHALL continue operating with in-memory state
2. WHEN a corrupted tab is detected during restoration THEN the system SHALL skip it and log a warning
3. WHEN file handle access fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to "Save As" functionality
4. WHEN tab restoration fails completely THEN the system SHALL start with a single default tab
5. WHEN an error occurs in tab operations THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
